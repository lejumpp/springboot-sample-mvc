The Model is the part of MVC which implements the domain logic. 
In simple terms, this logic is used to handle the data passed between the database and the user interface (UI).
The models folder will contain the files used to create the schema of the database. 
If we would like to create a table called 'customer' in our database we will create a 'Customer.java' file. 
We will then specify the table name, the different columns and their properties.
